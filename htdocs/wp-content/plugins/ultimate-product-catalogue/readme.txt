== Installation ==

1. Upload the `ultimate-product-catalogue` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Place "[product-catalogue id='X']" or [product-catalog id=’X’] on the page where you want your catalog to display, where X is the ID of the product catalog to display
4. *The page that displays the product catalog needs to be a full-width type page for the catalog to display correctly*

--------------------------------------------------------------

To get started using the product catalog plugin, you can:
- Go to the "Products" tab in the Ultimate Product Catalogue Plugin (UPCP) admin menu, add products to your product catalog one at a time or by uploading a spreadsheet
- Create product catalog categories in the "Categories" tab, then create sub-categories in the "Sub-Categories" tab and assign your sub-categories to the correct category. These will display in the sidebar of your product catalog.
- Create a product catalog in the "Catalogues" tab, then add products, categories, or sub-categories to that product catalog
- Add additional images to a product by clicking on it and then adding them from the "Product Details" screen
- Create tags in the "Tags" tab, then assign as many tags as necessary to each product from the "Product Details" screen. These will display in the sidebar of your product catalog.
- Re-order your product catalogs by dragging and dropping product catalog items in the "Catalog Details" screen


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display my product catalog? If I have more than one product catalog, what do I do? =

Put the following product catalog shortcode on whatever page you’re trying to put the product catalog on: ‘[product-catalogue id=’X’]’ or [product-catalog id=’X’]. Replace the ‘X’ with the ID of your product catalog. This can be found by clicking on your product catalog. The product catalog ID  is beside the product catalog name on the product catalog’s details page. You can also copy the product catalog shortcode directly from the “Catalogues” page.

To display one of your product catalogs, use the corresponding attribute ‘id='X'’ in the product-catalogue shortcode to specify that product catalog, where 'X' is replaced with the product catalog ID.

= Can my products be in more than one category or sub-category? =

No, products can only be in a single category and sub-category. Products can have as many tags desired, since tags are used to represent product attributes, and only tags that are used for a product within a product catalog are displayed in the product catalog sidebar.

= Can I load my product catalog with a layout other than the default "Thumbnail" product catalog layout? =

Add the attribute starting_layout=‘LAYOUT’ for your product catalog, where LAYOUT is replaced with the layout you would like to be the starting product catalog layout (List or Detail are the two options currently).

= I only want to display one product catalog layout and to remove the layout bar at the top from my product catalog? =

The attribute ‘excluded_layouts’ lets you stop one or more layouts from being displayed for your product catalog. It accepts a comma separated list of layouts you wish to exclude from your product catalog. For example, [product-catalogue id=‘X’ excluded_layouts=‘Thumbnail,List’] would make your product catalog display only the "Detail" view.

To remove the layout bar from your product catalog, you can try adding the following into your "Custom CSS" box for your product catalog (where the colour matches the colour of the product catalog you are using):

‘.Blue-prod-cat-header-div {display: none;}’

= My product description gets cut off even though I have changed the max characters for my product catalog, how can I fix this? =

There is a text area labelled "Custom CSS" when you click on the product catalog that you're editing. Try adding this to it:  ‘.prod-cat-addt-details-desc-div {max-height:none;}’

= How do I remove the sidebar from my product catalog? =

You can use the attribute [sidebar=‘No'] in the product-catalogue shortcode to remove the sidebar from a product catalog.

= Why aren’t my products uploading from the spreadsheet? =

There are a number of reasons why products might not be uploading correctly.
First, make sure that you’re uploading either a .xls or .xlsx file type (not .csv).
Second, make sure that you’ve written all of your field names correctly (Name, Slug, Description, Price, Image, Category, Sub-Category, Tags), especially custom fields, which need to be exactly the same as the field name.
Third, make sure that you don’t have any columns that have been edited unintentionally (which gives an “incorrect field name” error).

= How do I get custom changes I’ve made to the product page layout or the custom fields I’ve added in the product details to display? =

On  the “Options” page the “Custom Product Page” needs to be set to “Yes” for custom layout to display.

= How do I sort the order of the products within the catalog? =

You can arrange the order of the products by dragging and dropping the products on the “Catalogue Details” page .

= How do I translate the product catalog into my language? =
A great place to start learning about how to translate a plugin is at the link below: <http://premium.wpmudev.org/blog/how-to-translate-a-wordpress-plugin>

Once translated, you'll need to put the translated catalog mo- and po- files directly in the lang folder and make sure they are named properly for your localization.
If you do translate the product catalog, other users would love to have access to the files in your language. You can send them to us at Contact@EtoileWebDesign.com, and we’ll be sure they’re included in a future release.

= What is enabled in the 'Premium' version? =

The premium version includes a lot of great features including: the ability to add over 100 products, additional product images, SEO friendly product catalog URLs, product tags and custom fields for product catalog sorting, custom catalog product pages, a minimalist product catalog layout option and more!

* Super responsive tabbed layout with customizable tabs
* Drag-and-drop catalog product pages layout
* Lightbox, product inquiry form (using Contact Form 7) and product reviews (using <a href='https://wordpress.org/plugins/ultimate-reviews/'>Ultimate Reviews</a>)
